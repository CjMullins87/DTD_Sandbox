# Data to Dream:  HPD's Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) Data

As part of a collaboration with local data professionals and activists, we've consolidated all of HPD's OIS data into a single google spreadsheet. This spreadsheet contains demographic data for both suspects and officers involved in shooting incidents; it also contains officer provided synopses about the incident, helping to provide context to the officers' actions.

Spreadsheets are great for democratization of data:  there are few tools more accessible to the general public than an open access spreadsheet. However, while spreadhseets are powerful at storing and organizing individual data for reference and review, they are not great at organizing data into a meaningful picture. To organize data, we have to turn to tools that fewer users are familiar with:  pivot tables, pivot graphs, etc; and even these offer incomplete pictures of data.

To best inform community vision, we need to be able to query and dissect this data across axes that are inaccessible using spreadsheets and spreadsheet tools. To best meet this need, I've organized the data from the spreadsheet into a curated, open-source MySQL database that is accessible to data professionals. In an ideal case, this open-source database can be used by activist-minded organizations and organizers to derive macroscopic insights into OISs in the Houston area and drive conversations about current and future visions of policing.
